Project Statistics

Challenges and future work

Discussion of some of the challenges encountered during the project, e.g.:

Web scraping of BBC news was prone to errors and required regular updates to the code

Some features, such as file management and interactive media, could benefit from a more graphical user interface

Ideas for future work and improvements, e.g.:

Adding support for voice commands using speech recognition

Implementing a natural language processing engine to enable more conversational interactions

Integrating with more APIs and services, such as Google Maps or Spotify

Implementation of the Concept will contribute to:

ensuring compatibility with NATO's lifecycle policy and standards;

creating the preconditions for the implementation of effective life cycle management

 

coherence of actions of all subjects of management;

making optimal technical decisions;

minimizing the costs of the state budget;

reducing the time and risk of creation and adoption of weapons and military equipment, increasing the service life and stability of logistics support at this stage, as well as at the stage of decommissioning and disposal;

improving the efficiency of the national defence-industrial complex during the full life cycle;

improving the efficiency of budget resources, creating mechanisms for mutually beneficial relations between market-oriented integrated structures of the defen

с

e industry;

reduction of corruption risks and unfair relations;

providing favorable conditions for attracting investment;

implementation of effective quality management systems (according to NATO standards), their certification by accredited conformity assessment bodies;

training a "critical mass" of highly qualified personnel and effective top managers in the defence sphere.

Aim (main points): 

development of the LCM system according to NATO principles and standards,

development of:  legal framework; system of basic standards; mechanism for mutually agreed and coordinated activities;

Identification of responsibilities of all actors in the LSM system

Terms:

short-term: until 2023;

medium-term: until 2025;

long-term: until 2035.

Conclusions and the way ahead

all respondents support the idea of improving the legal regulation of foreign investment in economic entities of strategic importance for national security;

illegal actions of some investors can assume a potential threat to national and economic security;

the screening mechanism should not be another barrier to investment, another factor of uncertainty and risk in investing in Ukraine;

enshrined in law admission mechanism for foreign investors to participate in the capital of Ukrainian strategic enterprises will reduce the corruption risks associated with decision-making by individual officials, as well as make the procedure clear, transparent and, most importantly, sustainable;

in this context, further cooperation with NATO partners and nations on the foreign investment valuation system implementation in Ukraine, taking into account their experience in this field, is crucial. 

Thank you for your attention!
